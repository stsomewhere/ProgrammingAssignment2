## This function will create and use a cache for the results of a matrix operation
## Instead of comptuing the inverse of a matrix, it will allow the inverse to be cached and used

## This function will create a function with 4 funtions, set matrix, get matrix, set inverse, get inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
